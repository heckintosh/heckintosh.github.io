      <description>Hi there 👋, my name is Patrick aka 🔥 Lizard. I am a 22y Biomimicry student from Germany. I am interested in game, tool and engine development and have been working and messing around with game dev for over 4 years now. I also have prior (professional) knowledge in Python. Nowadays I work with GodotEngine on several open-source projects such as Godot itself, GDExtension and several VFX and Shader projects.</description>
